To build on linux, navigate to whodun2 and run make, then navigate to spht and run make.

There is a release for Windows.
If you are dead set on building yourself, install MinGW and make sure gcc.exe is on your path.
Then navigate to whodun2 and run MakeWin.bat, then navigate to spht and run MakeWin.bat.

The shell scripts run to get the data in the paper are included, and are a useful starting point for running them yourself.
They were run on a SLURM cluster (linux), so some translation will be needed for other systems.
